      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been meal planning for the week, but get to the grocery store and realize that you're a poor college kid who can't afford anything? Today is your lucky day, because as a certified expert in cooking on a college budget, I have perfected many cheap meals that I have compiled into one bite sized Compendium of College Cuisine. These recipes are free for all to use, and will allow you to eat for the first time in a long time without your wallet having a stroke. I do this service for my fellow college students just trying to make it through without having to take out a loan to pay for groceries, or those trying to remember the good old poor days.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is for anybody from the poorest of the poor trying to scrape by to those who can afford to go to the grocery store without anything even resembling a budget.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Home Page will include an about us section explaining what this website is all about and why I decided to create it.
        It'll include some background information about me, and why I am qualified to be teaching others some of my favorite recipes
        Also, it will explain what the target audience is (it's everybody), and why this specific website can meet their needs rather
        than another one. It will also reassure them that they basically don't need any knowledge or skill of cooking to do these things.

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        This is the page where the recipes will go. It will list the ingredients needed for each individual recipe, the tools
        needed for the job, and the prep/cook time for each. Each recipe will then have a walkthrough on how to prep it and
        cook it, as well as some more advanced variations the reader can try out. I am currently making 3 recipes, but that may 
        change in the future.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        This page will cover some of the confusion that comes with cooking, will offer alternate ways of cooking the recipes, and
        in general just answer questions people may have.
