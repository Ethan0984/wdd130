        Q. How is this website better than any other recipe site?
      </h3>
      <p class="a1">
        This website is not meant to be be better than other sites, it just
        specializes in certain recipes to help anybody who may need it. If you
        need to use another site, that's great, we wish you the best in your
        culinary adventures.
      </p>
      <h3 class="q2">
        What are some other recipes that are cheap and easy to make?
      </h3>
      <p class="a2">
        We can't cover every easy recipe in existence, but there are many
        recipes using pasta, rice, potatoes, or chicken that are quite easy to
        make, and we encourage you to explore those areas for some possible new
        go-to meals.
      </p>
      <h3 class="q3">
        What are some additional things to add to these recipes?
      </h3>
      <p class="a3">
        You could add beans or meat to quesadillas to spice them up a bit. For
        spaghetti, add italian sausage and parmesan to give off more flavor. And
        for baked potatoes, there is always sour cream, bacon, green onions, and
        chives you could add on for an extra kick.
